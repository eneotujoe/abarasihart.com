				Dr Abarasi Abbey-Hart graduated with a BEng in Chemical Engineering (First Class) from Niger Delta University in 2006, where he was awarded the Vice-Chancellor’s medal as the overall best graduating student of 2006 academic session. Not satisfied with first degree, he proceeded to University of Birmingham UK, where he obtained his MSc in Advanced Chemical Engineering (Distinction) in 2010 under the Joint University of Birmingham and Allan & Nesta Ferguson Charitable Trust (ANFCT) scholarship and scholarship from His Majesty, King Edward Asimini William Dappa Pepple, Perekule XI, Amayanabo of Grand Bonny Kingdom, Bonny. Consequently, a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the same university in 2014, based on Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) and School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham scholarships.

				Dr Abbey-Hart is a recipient of numerous scholarships awards, medals including the diamond academic of the Niger Delta University in 2014.
				He worked briefly as a lecturer in the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Port Harcourt (2008-2012). At the completion of his PhD, he was appointed senior research fellow in the School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, UK from 2014 to 2020 for research into in-situ catalytic upgrading of heavy crude oil based on the novel Toe-to-Heel Air Injection (THAI) process and its add-on CAPRI (Catalytic upgrading process in-situ). Where he designed a novel catalyst that converts electromagnetic energy into heat while performing catalytic function, research into mechanisms of minimising catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and heavy metal deposition and the application bionanocatalyst for underground cracking of heavy oil.

			<p>
				From January 2021 to 2023, he worked as a Faraday Institution Fellow on FutureCat at the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, the University of Sheffield UK, where he researched into mesoscale control of cathode materials’ microstructure in lithium-ion battery for vehicles and renewable energy storage.
				Since February 2023, he leads the design of heterogeneous catalysts and operation of the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil from lignocellulosic woody biomass into kerosene and diesel hydrocarbon fuel range, including troubleshooting operations as a Senior Research Fellow at the Energy and Bioproducts Research Institute, Aston University, Birmingham.
			</p>
			<p>
				He is also a visiting academic of the University of Port Harcourt and Niger Delta University working on the conversion of local shell materials (e.g., oyster, eggshell, and periwinkle shells and waste bones) into catalyst for industrial applications and bioremediation of kpo fire oil contaminated sites.
				He is an editorial board member of the International Journal of Oil, Gas and Coal Engineering and International Journal of Petroleum Technology and has reviewed over 150 journal articles and 15 research grant proposals from Canada, United States, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. He is member of numerous professional bodies such as Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), Nigeria Society of Engineers, Nigeria Institute of Management (NIM), American Chemical Society (ACS) and a fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA), UK. He received one of the top reviewers’ awards from Publons.com in 2017 (www.publons.com). In 2020, he was endorsed by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering as an emerging leader in the field of catalysis.

				His expertise includes Environmental Catalysis (Green and sustainable catalysts, clean fuel and energy technology, Sustainable chemicals catalysis, clean water processing, hydrogen production, and pollution and waste control), as well as energy and sustainability through resource recovery, utilisation and valorisation of waste (e.g., biomass, bio-waste, food waste, waste shells and bones, plastics and e-waste) for materials, biomaterials, fuel, energy carriers, catalysts, and chemicals production, and food safety and emerging food processing technologies. He also works on energy material technology, and bioenergy and bioprdoucts. He has published over 70 refereed research articles in high scientific journals, 3 book chapters, plus over 15 conference papers covering a range of topics in catalysis, biomaterials, particle technology, bioenergy, food safety and emerging processing technology, environmental pollution and management. He has H-index of 21 (Google scholar) with over 2000 citations (Abarasi Hart). He is on the global list of top 100 scientists in heavy crude oil processing.
